    "\n",
    "We have three parties: \"Alice\", \"Bob\" and \"Charlie\". Each one receives, respectively, bits x, y and z from $\\{000, 011, 101, 110\\}$ as inputs, then each one responds with bits a, b and c. They win the game if a, b and c are such that the following is satisfied\n",

    "They can talk and decide a strategy beforehand, but they are unable to comunicate during the game. Classicaly, the best strategy guarantees that they will win with probability $0.75$. But if instead of outputing classical bits they output the measurements of the shared quantum state\n",
